# Data cleaning for promprint project
First run is for sample data found at the national library of Scotland:

https://data.nls.uk/data/metadata-collections/catalogue-published-material/

Priority is to clean the dates so that we can filter down to ones that are relevant to specific copyright registers.

We can import into the database directly from there, but at some point we should also clean the author column for more robust checking of a match.
